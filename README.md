# AzIoTHubDeviceStreaming
A set of projects examining refactoring of the Azure IoTHub SDK Device Streaming Echo sample functionality as a .Net Core and as a UWP reusable library.

# Status
The .Net Core library implements Azure IoT Hub connectivity for the Device and Service sample apps. These both works with the functionality moved to the library. When the app is a UWP app though, whether as an XAML or Console app, the service reference works OK but the device references does not. THi sis true whether the libarray is implemeneted as a .Net Core class library or as a UWP class library.
